# Linked List Visualizer 
Visualizing linked list `add` and `delete` operation using Java Swing UI library. 

## Developer setup
**Requirements**: Java 21, VSCode (or any IDE of choice)

1.  Ask @lanphgphm to be added as project collaborator.

2.  Clone this repository with: 
    `git clone https://github.com/lanphgphm/linked-list-visualizer.git`

    Create your own branch and switch to it with: 
    `git checkout -b <branch name>`

3.  Start adding code! 
    All code files should begin with these imports: 

    ```java
    import javax.swing.*;
    import java.awt.*;
    ```

    Currently, the project is organized like this: 
    ![Alt text](/project-documents/project-structure.png) 

    And the class hierarchy looks like this:

4.  Push your code to this repository
    Before pushing, always pull any changes from upstream with: 
    `git pull` 

    Then, stage, commit, and push your code: 

    `git add .`

    `git commit -m "<commit message>"`

    `git push -u origin <branch name>` (first time), or `git push` (not first time)

## User installation 
Currently, this product is not done therefore it is not shippable to users :)
 
Installation guide would be updated in due time.
